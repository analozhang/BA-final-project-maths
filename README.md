# GeneralizedEstimatingEquations
Frequently, research design involves multiple measurements of a response variable. In contrast to cross-sectional data, where a single response is measured for each individual, longitudinal data are repeated measurements of the same individuals over time. Therefore, the treatment of longitudinal data by means of classical models is inappropriate, since measurements are conducted over time on the same individual, which may be correlated.

Liang and Zeger (1986) introduce an extension of the Generalized Linear Model for the analysis of longitudinal data, where intra-subject correlation is taken into account
in the estimation of regression parameters of a marginal expectation model and it is assumed that the marginal distribution of the variable belongs to the exponential family. This methodology is known as Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).

The code provided is part of my Bachelor's Thesis in Mathematics and Statistics, whose aim is to analyze the GEE methodology and to compare the results with the Generalized Linear Model.
